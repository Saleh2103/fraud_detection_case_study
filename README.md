Based on the comprehensive evaluation presented in the evaluation metrics, it is evident that different machine 
learning models and techniques exhibit varying degrees of effectiveness in fraud detection. Logistic Regression models 
consistently achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, underscoring their reliability in identifying 
fraudulent activities. Gradient Boosting Machines and Random Forest models also demonstrated strong performance 
across different encoding techniques, emphasizing their robustness in fraud detection tasks. Furthermore, the 
inclusion of the GRU model, leveraging a combination of encoding, standardization, and embedding, showcased 
competitive accuracy. Considering all factors, including performance metrics, computational efficiency, and ease of 
implementation, the Random Forest model with SMOTE augmentation emerges as the top choice for fraud detection. 
Its consistently high accuracy, precision, and recall, along with its ability to handle large feature sets and potential 
outliers, make it an optimal solution for detecting fraudulent activities effectively and efficiently
